            RetrieveApp was born from recognizing the daily frustration of lost
            items in shared spaces like campuses, libraries, and caf√©s. Our
            dedicated team collaborated through Code the Dream's Practicum
            program to create a centralized platform where communities can post,
            search, and reunite people with their belongings through interactive
            maps and direct messaging. This project represents not only our
            technical growth in full-stack development but also our commitment
            to building meaningful solutions that bring communities together,
            made possible through the invaluable mentorship and learning
            opportunities provided by Code the Dream.
