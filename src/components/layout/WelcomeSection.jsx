            RetrieveApp was created to solve the everyday frustration of losing
            items in shared spaces like campuses, libraries, and caf√©s. Built
            through Code the Dream's Practicum, it connects communities through
            a centralized platform for posting, searching, and reuniting lost
            belongings with interactive maps and messaging features. More than a
            project, it reflects our growth as developers and our mission to
            build tools that bring people together.
